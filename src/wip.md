- Builds upon the #363 PR for [typescript migration](https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js/issues/355)
- Added and implemented RDFJS Taskforce types, included these in the `types.ts` file. I tried implementing the Taskforce types in the major classes, but some of the incompatibilities make it difficult. Many available methods on rdfjs instances (e.g. `.toNt()` in NamedNode), are missing in Taskforce classes. To improve Taskforce comatibility, we should minimize using rdflib specific functions. This would for example enable using Forumla methods on RDFExt nodes. We should use the Taskforce types (Term, RDFJSQuad) as much as possible, instead of rdflib types (Node, Statement).
- Switched internal calls from `sameTerm` to `equals`
- Migrated `formula`, `variable` and `parse` tot ts
- Added some typeguards, e.g. `isNamedNode` in `named-node.ts`
- Use enums for `termType`, without breaking compatibility with regular strings
- The 'optional' argument in `formula.js` does not seem to be documented, used or tested - should it be removed?
- Removed the `justOne` argument from `formula.statementsMatching`, since it was unused. Also edited the call in `anyStatementMatching`
- Did some cleanup of unreachable code.
- `Node.substitute()` didn't to anything, so I removed it.
- Formula Constructor arguments are optional - since some functions initialize empty Formulas
- Removed the last conditional of `Formula.holds()`, since it did not make sense
